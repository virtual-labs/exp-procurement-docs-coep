Procurement is a critical activity in the life of any project. Careful consideration and thought needs to be applied before procuring any instrument or control system. Just as a reminder any mistake in this process will lead to enormous loss to the project and ultimately customer suffers. Here is a generic list of activities and dos and donâ€™ts.

##### Step 1: Identification of Need

The process begins with the identification of a need for new or replacement instrument by the operations team, maintenance team, or engineering team.
The need is typically driven by a problem or opportunity, such as:
-	Equipment failure or obsolescence
-	Increased production demands
-	Process optimization or improvement
-	Compliance with regulatory requirements
-	Safety concerns

##### Step 2: Feasibility Study and Budgeting

A feasibility study is conducted to determine the viability of the project, including:

##### Technical feasibility:
Can the equipment be designed and built to meet the required specifications?

##### Financial feasibility: 
Can the project be justified based on cost-benefit analysis?

##### Operational feasibility: 
Can the equipment be integrated into the existing process and operated safely and efficiently? 
A preliminary budget is established based on the feasibility study.                    


##### Step 3: Specification Development

A detailed specification is developed for the required equipment, including:

##### Technical specifications: 
performance requirements, materials, dimensions, etc.

##### Functional specifications: 
operating conditions, capacity, etc.

##### Safety specifications: 
safety features, certifications, etc.

##### Quality specifications: 
quality control measures, testing requirements, etc.

The specification is reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders.


##### Step 4: Vendor Selection and Pre-Qualification

A list of potential vendors is identified through:
-	Industry research
-	Referrals
-	Online directories
-	Trade shows and conferences
-	Vendors are pre-qualified based on:
-	Experience and reputation
-	Technical capability
-	Financial stability
-	Quality management systems
-	Compliance with regulatory requirements


##### Step 5: Request for Quotation (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP)

An RFQ or RFP is issued to the pre-qualified vendors, including:
-	Detailed specifications
-	Technical requirements
-	Commercial terms and conditions
-	Timeline for delivery and installation
-	Evaluation criteria
-	Vendors are given a deadline to respond with a quote or proposal.


##### Step 6: Bid Evaluation

The bids are evaluated based on the specified evaluation criteria, including:
-	Technical compliance
-	Commercial terms and conditions
-	Delivery and installation timeline
-	Vendor experience and reputation
-	Quality management systems
-	Compliance with regulatory requirements
A shortlist of vendors is identified based on the evaluation.


##### Step 7: Negotiation and Contracting

Negotiations are conducted with the shortlisted vendors to finalize the terms and conditions, including:
-	Price
-	Delivery and installation timeline
-	Warranty and maintenance requirements
-	Payment terms
-	Contract duration and termination clauses
-	A contract is awarded to the selected vendor.


##### Step 8: Equipment Design and Fabrication

The selected vendor designs and fabricates the equipment according to the agreed specifications and timeline.
The equipment is manufactured, tested, and inspected to ensure compliance with the specifications.


##### Step 9: Delivery and Installation

The equipment is delivered to the site and installed according to the agreed timeline and specifications.
The installation is inspected and tested to ensure compliance with the specifications.


##### Step 10: Commissioning and Testing

The equipment is commissioned and tested to ensure it meets the required specifications and performance criteria.
Any defects or issues are identified and rectified.


##### Step 11: Final Acceptance and Payment

The equipment is finally accepted by the purchaser upon completion of commissioning and testing.
Payment is made to the vendor according to the agreed terms and conditions.


##### Step 12: Post-Purchase Support

The vendor provides post-purchase support, including:
-	Training and operation manuals
-	Maintenance and repair services
-	Spare parts and consumables
-	Warranty and guarantee support

This is a general outline of the purchase process for process plant equipment procurement. The specific steps and requirements may vary depending on the organization, industry, and need to be studied before commencement of procurement process.
